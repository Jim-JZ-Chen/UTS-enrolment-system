UX is defined as a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use of a product, system or service. Understanding how to approach UX in design is a major focus in interaction design because the quality of UX can affect people's adoption of a particular designed technology. For many technology design companies, paying attention to how people experience their products is the edge that can potentially set them apart from their competition. However, designing UX effectively is difficult because the term UX is very problematic, meaning very different things to different people, in academic research and in industry. UX is often just the trendy term to define usability.</p> <p>Firstly, students are provided with some conceptual tools to help them talk about UX productively: to identify, describe, analyse and critique real-life experiences with various types of digital technologies. To put these skills into practice, students are introduced to a range of current and emergent human-computer interactions such as mobile and social computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, quantified self, and the 'internet of things' (IoT). Through discussing and exploring particular characteristics, interaction styles, affordances, and the ways these technologies are used in our everyday lives, students develop the skills to be able to understand the types of user experiences that arise from people's interactions with particular technologies, while pursuing specific goals, whether alone or with others, carried out in particular contexts. Through this, they understand how to consider relevant and appropriate user experiences to support when designing for different kinds of human-computer interactions.</p> <p>Students also learn methods, concepts, and techniques used in design activities to support for a specific user experience. This includes user research techniques, sketching, storyboarding, prototyping and evaluation approaches that can support them to design appropriate and engaging user experiences. They hone their skills through responding to a real-world problem, designing a technology solution that not only meets the users' needs effectively but, more importantly, supports desirable and potentially engaging experiences. By building upon students' prior understandings of fundamental interaction design concepts and processes, it is expected that when they successfully complete this subject, they are able to not only design useful and usable technologies, but also technologies that are optimised to support the users' experience. Finally, each week, an industry guest working with UX is invited to the lecture/workshop where she or he will participate in an informal discussion and answer questions about different aspects of UX in the industry.</p>	<h3>Typical availability</h3>	<p>Spring session, City campus</p>	<a>31777</a>

The major objectives of business intelligence is to enable interactive access to data and to give business managers the ability to conduct analysis and make better decisions. Decision support systems are computer-based information systems that combine models/methods and data in an attempt to solve semi/non-structured decision problems with extensive user involvement through a friendly user interface. Business high-level decisions are often semi/non-structured and require an increased level of intelligent and technical support, in particular, when they become rich in data. Decision support systems can be integrated with variable business intelligence techniques to support related decision problem solving.This subject introduces business intelligence, decision support systems, group decision support, intelligent decision support, web-based support systems, decision optimisation technologies, personalised recommender systems.

A major concern of businesses is the search for competitive advantage and how to best leverage IT resources and align them with business goals to achieve competitive advantage. For IT managers, this raises a number of complex issues to understand and manage. These issues relate to the roles of IT and IT strategy in enabling business processes and generating business benefits. In this subject, theories and methods related to the value of IT are presented and explored. Students learn and discuss business and strategy processes that lead to learning organisations that can achieve sustainable competitive advantage.</p> <p>Business processes and IT strategy are key concerns for business and IT managers. Managing information is a critical skill for success in today's business environment. Managers need to know about their organisation's capabilities and uses of information resources. This subject aims to provide a foundation to help general business managers become knowledgeable participants in decision-making processes related to information systems (IS). Critically reviewing the contributions of IS resources in businesses and organisational settings establishes a contextual understanding of how IS permeates many aspects of business.</p> <p>Through case studies this subject reinforces material provided in lectures and tutorials, additional research, and prior knowledge while giving groups of students scope to enhance their problem-solving, critical thinking and organisational skills as well as peer learning.

Sustainability here is viewed from multidimensional perspectives to encompass environmental, technological, social, and economic sustainability of contemporary organisations and their operations. To achieve sustainability objectives, collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders, often mediated through the use of information technologies and collaborative media, is essential. This however poses significant and often existential challenges to many organisations attempting to apply traditional, structured, and short-term approaches in their operations, as well as considerable opportunities for innovative, collaborative, technology savvy, and long-term focused organisations.</p> <p>Consequently, the subject invites students to proactively and innovatively reflect on these issues and their effect on organisational leadership and management. In such reflection, students are encouraged to consider various real and hypothetical case-based scenarios, where they identify and evaluate challenges to sustainability, and recommend informed, innovative, collaborative, and rigorously supported arguments and policy initiatives.</p>	<a>42900</a>

This subject teaches how to plan, implement and improve quality management processes, and how such systems are common to almost every organisation. Software and systems products are often complex and increasingly part of life critical systems, with matching demands on their development methods and quality management. This subject reviews how quality management systems are an integral part of organisation management, how quality management systems are spread through the different layers of organisations, and how such systems operate. Real-world examples are used throughout the subject to examine aspects of quality management systems, culminating in an industry-based project to devise an improvement to solve a quality management system problem.</p>	<h3>Typical availability</h3>	<p>Autumn session, City campus</p>	<a>32603</a>

Students learn to compute orders of complexity for various practical problems.</p> <p>An understanding of computational complexity can lead to the design of economical and feasible products and services. For example, for an online taxi service, strategically simplifying the computation can dramatically reduce the cost of solving the very large-scale passenger-driver matching problem.</p> <p>Similarly, mastering the fundamental theory of computation enables one to construct security schemes that are both convenient for users and tough against attackers. Also, in programming, the knowledge of how high-level statements are translated into operational instructions helps one identify performance bottlenecks to achieve optimal efficiency by appropriate design of the algorithm.</p>	<h3>Typical availability</h3>	<p>Spring session, City campus</p>	<a>41080</a>
